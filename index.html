        <p>Achinta looked under no pressure whatsoever as he lifted 137kg in his first snatch attempt, 140 in the second and 143 in the third, which gave him a 5kg advantage above everyone else. Positioned easily at the top, Achinta then set himself for the part of the event which he is the master of, the Clean & Jerk series.

            Achinta successfully lifted 166kg in his first attempt in Clean & Jerk which straightaway placed him in gold-medal position, although he missed pulling off 170kg in his second attempt, one that gave Malaysia's Erry Hidayat the opportunity to make a comeback. But with the latter fumbling while attempting a 176kg lift in his second and final attempt, and Achinta nailing the 170kg lift in his last, a third gold was assured for India with a rather dominating performance.</p>

        <h1>Gold for second time in a row</h1>
        <p>India’s paddlers retained their men’s team championship title with a convincing 3-1 win over Singapore in the Commonwealth Games at Birmingham on Tuesday.

            After Sharath Kamal’s shock loss to southpaw Clarence Chew, Harmeet Desai put on a stunning show against Chew to seal the deal in India’s favour.
            
            The final was a repeat of the group-stage affair between the two CWG table tennis powerhouses. With India having trumped Singapore 3-0, the latter changed its combination.
            
            The reliable duo of Harmeet and G. Sathiyan got India off to an ideal start, with a 3-0 win in the lone doubles rubber against Koen Pang and Izaac Quek. While Sathiyan was solid with his forehand topspins, Harmeet stole the show with his backhand blocks to give India the lead..</p>
